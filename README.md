🚀 🚀  An Endless retro space-shooter game with a twist of on modern technological themes  🚀 🚀 

## Your Goal - Go for the Highest Score!

Inspired by SpaceX and Elon Musk’s vision of sending his Starship space vehicle to Mars. The game imagines a scenario in which Starship arrives to Mars to
find itself being attacked by alien spacecraft 👽  modelled on Musk’s own Tesla Roadster 🚗  (that he had earlier launched in the direction of Mars). The Starship has to dodge the alien Roadsters, incurring
damage if it crashes into them; its only defence is an onboard Bitcoin mine ⛏️ which creates Bitcoins that are ‘fired’ at the roadsters, destroying them on impact. You get may get lucky and launch the ***legendary dogecoin*** 
that is able to hit multiple roadsters at once. 

## Game info

- 3 lives
- Starship starts with 0% damage but if it collides with an alien Roadster it incurs 10% damage
- When Starship reaches 100% damage, the player loses a life
- Game ends once all the lives are lost
- Takes game once cycle to increase your miner. So if your system runs the game faster, 💰 📈 
- There are always 20 👽 Roadsters on the game screen at any time
- The Starship can only launch a Bitcoin to defend itself when the ‘Bitcoin Mining’ display shows 100%. Once launched it is reset to 0%
- Bitcoins travel in a straight line
- Supercoins travel at a random angle and reset their angle once they hit a roadster
